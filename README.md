# Movie Search Tool (Spring 2021)
A movie/television series search tool using the Open Movie Database API developed as the final project for my Asynchronous JavaScript and XML course.  The user can search for a movie/television series and the tool will display results matching the search term. The user can click any of the results for details about the movie/television series. Programmed using the Fetch API.
